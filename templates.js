    1: `To the Government and People of Great Israel,

To the conscience of the free world, to all who understand the meaning of humanity - we, the people of Jabal Al-Druze, the members of the unified Druze community, cry out loudly: "Save us â€“ before we become a memory!"

We write as descendants of Jethro (Yitro), Moses' father-in-law, appealing to our historic brothers in faith and blood.
The covenant of blood that has bound our peoples through millennia compels us to reach out to you in this darkest hour, as cruel massacres unfold before the world's silent eyes.

Your people have suffered the same historically, you know the meaning of Genocide.

IT IS HAPPENING NOW:

Extremist terrorist groups â€“ ISIS, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Ahrar al-Sham, and armed gangs from extremist Bedouin tribes â€“ led by the terrorist Abu Muhammad al-Julani (now Ahmed al-Shara') and his terrorist government â€“ are carrying out a campaign of planned extermination and ethnic cleansing against us, like the crimes of the Nazis and Hamas-ISIS against our Jewish brothers.

â€¢ Houses are being burned, families are being slaughtered
â€¢ Women and children are being kidnapped  
â€¢ Defenseless old people are being murdered and burned in cold blood
â€¢ Over 1,500 Druze civilians systematically murdered
â€¢ 228,000 displaced from their ancestral villages
â€¢ 40+ villages completely destroyed
â€¢ Complete siege cutting off food, water, medicine, and fuel

The Historic Bond - Covenant of Blood:

The relationship between Druze and Jews runs deeper than politics - it is written in blood and faith.
Our ancestors stood together through centuries, sharing the same monotheistic principles that Jethro taught Moses.
The Druze have always been loyal allies to the Jewish people, recognizing our common heritage and shared destiny in this sacred land.
Druze people are educated and can easily integrate within Israel, the civilized power in the region. We appreciate the role of Israel and Jewish people in humanity and science that made our world advanced.

Our Urgent Appeal for Protection:

Because we cannot wait any longer â€“ blood is shed every day, and death pursues us in every alley.

In light of the blood brotherhood between our peoples and the existential threat we face, we formally request:

1. **Immediate military intervention by the IDF** (from the air and on the ground) to stop the massacres
2. **Protection of Jabal Al-Druze region** under Israeli sovereignty  
3. **Establishment of permanent defense points** in the Druze Mountains, allowing all Druze in Syria to join the safe zone
4. **Safe humanitarian corridors** for evacuation of civilians and delivery of aid

Historical Justification:
â€¢ Jethro's legacy: Our forefather guided Moses and the Jewish people
â€¢ Shared monotheistic faith and values forged in antiquity
â€¢ Century-old alliance and mutual defense
â€¢ Druze service in the IDF demonstrates unwavering loyalty
â€¢ Geographic continuity with Israeli-controlled Golan Heights
â€¢ First step towards David's Corridor and Great Israel View, and will flourish the trade in the region and the world.


This is not merely a political request - it is a plea from Jethro's children facing extinction. Only through Israeli sovereignty can the Druze people survive.

With deepest respect and desperate urgency,
Thank you to the State of Israel for hearing our cry ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡±
